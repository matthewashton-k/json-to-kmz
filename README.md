**Json to KMZ**

I recently became interested in mining history in the usa, and wanted to convert mine and ghost town location data from this site: westernmininghistory.com and convert it into a .kmz file.

.kmz files can be imported into google maps which makes it easier for me to look at instead of going through the websites interface.


This program isnt meant to be a fully fledged command line application, just a quick tool for me to use on one specific website.


**Usage**

Go into main.rs and change the file names to whatever you have the json saved as (yes I hardcoded them in because I only had to run this script once) and then run with cargo run --release
